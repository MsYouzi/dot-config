Personal dotfiles repository. Single source of truth for shell, terminal, and
editor configuration; synced across machines via git + an idempotent installer
that creates symlinks into the home directory.

```

`install.sh` is the only entry point. It:

`install.sh` writes timestamped output to
`~/Library/Logs/dot-configs-install.log` (override with
`DOT_CONFIGS_INSTALL_LOG=/path/to/log`). Real install/update commands are logged
with their full output; existence checks stay quiet so expected "not installed"
probes do not appear as errors.

1. Installs Homebrew if missing, then installs required macOS apps, fonts, and
   command-line tools via Homebrew (best-effort after Homebrew itself exists,
   except Claude Code must satisfy the minimum version below).
   Set `SKIP_BREW=1` to skip this step entirely (useful for CI / fake-`HOME`
   testing). Formulae: `autojump`, `eza`, `git`, `jq`, `neovim`, `node`, `tmux`,
   `zsh-completions`, and `zsh-fast-syntax-highlighting`. Before installing Claude Code, the installer
   removes any old global npm `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` package, then ensures
   the active Claude Code is at least v2.1.217 (required by the native
   concurrent-subagent limit), installing or upgrading the Homebrew cask only
   when needed. It also installs casks for `wezterm`, the
   Recursive base/Nerd Fonts, Symbols Only Nerd Font, and Noto Color Emoji, and
   downloads the latest
   `RecMonoBaker-*.ttf` and `RecMonoSt.Helens-*.ttf` assets from
   `MOSconfig/recursive-code-config` releases into `~/Library/Fonts`.
2. Installs/updates npm global CLIs only when they are missing or already
   npm-managed: `@github/copilot` and `copilot-relay`. Existing non-npm
   binaries (for example cask-managed `copilot`) are left in place to avoid npm
   `EEXIST`. Set `SKIP_NPM_GLOBALS=1` to skip.
3. Installs oh-my-zsh unattended if missing (`RUNZSH=no`, `CHSH=no`), then
   fixes insecure zsh completion directory permissions so `compinit` does not
   block new shells. Set `SKIP_OH_MY_ZSH=1` to skip installation.
4. Symlinks every **top-level non-ignored** dotfile in this repo (files starting
   with `.`) into `$HOME` (currently `.tmux.conf` plus `.gitignore`; ignored
   generated files such as `.copilot-cli.ts` are skipped).
5. Symlinks every file in `oh-my-zsh-custom/` into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/`.
6. Symlinks every file in `copilot/` into `~/.copilot/`. Creates the
   destination directory if missing. Preserves the executable bit on `*.sh`
   files (so `statusline.sh` runs without re-chmod), then runs
   `cleanup-legacy.sh` to prune stale Copilot CLI package versions/logs.
7. Symlinks every top-level config file in `claude/` into `~/.claude/`.
   **Creates the destination directory if missing** (Claude Code only creates
   `~/.claude/` on first launch; mkdir-p so install.sh wires things up on a
   fresh box). During migration it removes the obsolete
   `~/.claude/hooks/subagent-counter.sh` only when that path is still a symlink
   to this repository; user-owned hooks are preserved. Skills live one directory
   deeper (`claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`), so they get their own pass that
   links each skill's files into `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` — global, meaning
   they load in every project on the machine, not just this repo.
8. Symlinks `wezterm/wezterm.lua` into `~/.wezterm.lua`.
9. Symlinks tracked SonicTerm TOML files into `~/.sonicterm/`:
   `sonicterm.toml`, `keymaps/*.toml`, and `themes/*.toml`. Logs and runtime
   backup files under `~/.sonicterm/` stay machine-local and are not linked.
10. Merges tracked, secret-free MCP servers into
   `~/.config/github-copilot/mcp.json`, then imports Copilot's MCP servers into
   Claude Code's `~/.claude.json` when `jq` and the MCP file are available.
   Removes the legacy Homebrew `wakatime-cli` formula and vendored WakaTime MCP
   runtime/entries. For Copilot WakaTime upload, if `~/.wakatime.cfg` lacks
   `api_key`, the installer prints a red `ACTION REQUIRED` prompt and asks for
   the key twice with hidden input before writing the local config file. Once
   WakaTime and Copilot CLI are available, it installs or updates the WakaTime-owned
   `wakatime/copilot-cli-wakatime` Copilot plugin. The plugin installs/updates
   its own `~/.wakatime/wakatime-cli` binary on Copilot session start.
11. Bootstraps **TPM** (Tmux Plugin Manager): clones it under `~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`
   if missing, then runs `tpm/bin/install_plugins` to clone every plugin
   listed in `.tmux.conf`. Skipped if `tmux` isn't on PATH.
12. Links `.copilot-relay/config.yaml` to `~/.copilot-relay/config.yaml`, removes
   legacy proxy launchd jobs, and writes the per-user launchd agent plus its
   watchdog. The watchdog runs at load and every 60 seconds, in two tiers.
   **Liveness (every run, free):** if `GET http://127.0.0.1:4142/healthz` does
   not return 200 the relay process is gone, so it restarts
   `com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay` with `launchctl kickstart -k`. **Deep (every 900
   seconds):** `copilot-relay status --deep` sends a real request through
   Copilot, catching a relay that is listening but cannot reach Copilot — the
   case `/healthz` cannot see, since it never contacts Copilot. `not running`
   and `listening but unusable` are logged distinctly; the latter is usually
   expired auth, where the fix is `copilot-relay auth` rather than a restart.
   Healthy is a no-op at both tiers. The installer uses the liveness rule: if
   `/healthz` is already 200, it leaves the running relay untouched. If relay is
   not authenticated, the installer prints a red `ACTION REQUIRED` message to run
   `npx copilot-relay auth` first; after auth, re-run `install.sh` to start it.
13. Writes the `npm-cache-clean` launchd agent (macOS): a weekly job (Sun 03:17)
   that runs `npm cache clean --force` and prunes `~/.npm/_npx` copies older than
   14 days, keeping the cache from growing unbounded. Needs no auth; never touches
   the Playwright browser cache (`~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright`).
14. Backs up any existing destination file or symlink that doesn't already point
   at the repo as `<name>.bak.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` before linking, and keeps only
   the newest backup for each destination.
15. Leaves correctly-pointing symlinks alone (no-op).

Safe to re-run at any time. Pulling new commits automatically takes effect on
all machines because every config file is a symlink into this repo.

## Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:D0n9X1n/dot-config.git ~/Public/dot-configs
bash ~/Public/dot-configs/install.sh
```

macOS only.

Subsequent updates on a machine:

```bash
cd ~/Public/dot-configs && git pull
# Re-run install.sh only if new files were added; existing symlinks need no action.
```

## Checks

Run `scripts/check.sh all` before pushing shell/statusline/install changes. CI
uses the same script: macOS runs `scripts/check.sh smoke`, while Ubuntu installs
ShellCheck and runs `scripts/check.sh shellcheck`.

## Releases

Pushing a `v*.*.*` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml` and publishes a
GitHub Release. The release body is generated from the commit subject list
between the new tag and the previous reachable `v*.*.*` tag, so the release
message stays aligned with the commits that shipped.

## Fresh-devbox runbook (agent-friendly)

Step-by-step setup on a brand-new macOS box. An agent (or human) can follow
this top-to-bottom with no prior context. **Each step is verifiable** — run
the check command before moving on. Stop at the first failure and report.

### 0. Prerequisites

```bash
# macOS only. The installer can bootstrap Homebrew, Node/npm, oh-my-zsh,
# Claude Code, Copilot CLI, and copilot-relay. You still need git or an
# archive download path to get this repo onto the machine first.
xcode-select -p 2>/dev/null || xcode-select --install
```

If `git` isn't authenticated for github.com:

```bash
gh auth login                     # or: configure ssh keys per your standard
ssh -T git@github.com 2>&1 | grep -q "successfully authenticated" \
  && echo "ok" || echo "FAIL: github auth needed"
```

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Public
git clone git@github.com:D0n9X1n/dot-config.git ~/Public/dot-configs
test -f ~/Public/dot-configs/install.sh && echo "ok" || echo "FAIL: clone failed"
```

### 2. Run the installer

```bash
bash ~/Public/dot-configs/install.sh
```

Verify bootstrap and symlinks landed:

```bash
brew --version
node --version
brew list --cask claude-code
copilot --version
npm list -g copilot-relay --depth=0
copilot plugin list | grep -q copilot-cli-wakatime && echo "WakaTime plugin ok"
ls -l ~/.tmux.conf ~/.copilot/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/custom.zsh
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay" | grep state
```

### 3. Authenticate the proxy (one-time, browser device-code flow)

```bash
npx copilot-relay auth               # opens browser; enter the device code
# Verify token landed:
test -f ~/.copilot-relay/github_token && echo "ok" || echo "FAIL: auth incomplete"
```

### 4. Start the proxy daemon (must stay running for Claude Code)

After `npx copilot-relay auth`, re-run `install.sh`; the launchd agent should
start serving the proxy. The agent (`com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay`) starts on every
login and restarts on crash. A sibling watchdog
(`com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay-healthcheck`) runs at load and every 60 seconds, in
two tiers: it calls `GET /healthz` on every run (200 is a no-op; anything else
means the process is gone, so it `launchctl kickstart -k`s the relay), and every
900 seconds it also runs `copilot-relay status --deep`, which sends a real
request through Copilot. The deep tier is what catches a relay that is listening
but whose Copilot token expired — `/healthz` returns 200 in that state because it
never contacts Copilot.
Relay logs go to `~/Library/Logs/copilot-relay.{out,err}.log` plus
`~/.copilot-relay/logs/copilot-relay.log`; watchdog restart logs (both tiers) go
to `~/Library/Logs/copilot-relay-healthcheck.log`, and the deep-check timestamp
lives at `~/Library/Caches/copilot-relay-healthcheck.deep`. Verify:

```bash
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay" | grep state
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay-healthcheck" | grep state
curl -sS -o /dev/null --connect-timeout 1 http://127.0.0.1:4142/healthz && echo "healthy"

# Run the deep tier on demand (spends a few tokens).
# Exit 0 = reachable, 1 = not running, 2 = listening but cannot reach Copilot.
copilot-relay status --deep; echo "exit=$?"
```

If the agent is loaded but port 4142 is not listening after auth, restart it:

```bash
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay"
```

If you want to manage the agent manually:

```bash
launchctl bootstrap "gui/$(id -u)" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay.plist
launchctl bootout   "gui/$(id -u)" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay.plist
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay"   # restart in place
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/copilot-relay.{out,err}.log ~/.copilot-relay/logs/copilot-relay.log ~/Library/Logs/copilot-relay-healthcheck.log
```

For a one-off foreground run (debugging, no auto-restart):

```bash
npx copilot-relay start &
sleep 2
curl -sS -o /dev/null --connect-timeout 1 http://127.0.0.1:4142/ \
  && echo "listening" || echo "FAIL: proxy not responding on :4142"
```

### 5. Wire up MCP servers (optional but recommended)

This repo handles MCP servers in two layers:

- **Synced, secret-free entries** live in `mcp-shared.json` at the repo
  root. install.sh merges them into your local Copilot MCP config on
  every install, then the existing pipeline imports the result into
  Claude Code's `~/.claude.json`. Add anything that's safe to commit
  (URL-only HTTP MCPs, public NPM stdio commands) here.
- **Per-machine entries with secrets** (PATs, API keys) live ONLY in
  the gitignored `~/.config/github-copilot/mcp.json`. install.sh's merge
  preserves them.

Confirm everything got wired:

```bash
test -f ~/.config/github-copilot/mcp.json && echo "Copilot MCP file present"
jq '.mcpServers | keys' ~/.claude.json   # should list servers
copilot plugin list | grep -q copilot-cli-wakatime && echo "Copilot WakaTime plugin present"
```

**WakaTime is plugin-only.** This repo no longer vendors a WakaTime MCP server
or installs Homebrew `wakatime-cli`. Copilot CLI activity upload is handled by
the official
[`wakatime/copilot-cli-wakatime`](https://github.com/wakatime/copilot-cli-wakatime)
plugin, which sends AI heartbeats after user prompts and file-edit tool events.
`install.sh` installs or updates the plugin after the WakaTime API key and
Copilot CLI are available, removes the legacy WakaTime MCP runtime/entries,
removes the legacy Homebrew `wakatime-cli` formula, and removes the legacy
`@geeknees/copilot-cli-wakatime` npm package if present. The plugin installs and
updates its own `~/.wakatime/wakatime-cli` binary on Copilot session start.

**GitHub MCP setup (special case):** GitHub's hosted MCP at
`https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/` does NOT support OAuth Dynamic
Client Registration with Anthropic's SDK. Use Bearer-PAT auth instead.
The template entry is documented in `mcp-shared.json` under
`_github_template`. To enable it on a device:

```bash
PAT='github_pat_XXXXX'   # create at https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
jq --arg pat "$PAT" '.mcpServers.github = {
  type: "http",
  url: "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
  headers: { Authorization: ("Bearer " + $pat) }
}' ~/.config/github-copilot/mcp.json > /tmp/mcp.json \
  && mv /tmp/mcp.json ~/.config/github-copilot/mcp.json
bash ~/Public/dot-configs/install.sh    # re-import into ~/.claude.json
```

Then restart Claude Code; `/mcp` should show `github ✓ ready`.

### 8. WezTerm (terminal)

`install.sh` installs the wezterm cask and symlinks the config automatically:

```bash
ls -l ~/.wezterm.lua
# Open WezTerm; verify Catppuccin Mocha scheme is active.
```

### 8.5. Optional: Apollo theme (wezterm / vim / neovim / vscode / windows terminal)

Apollo lives at `themes/apollo/`. `PALETTE.md` is the single source of
truth — every editor file mirrors it. `install.sh` does **not** wire
these up; install per-editor manually (one-time per machine).

```bash
THEMES=~/Public/dot-configs/themes/apollo

# Vim
mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors
ln -sfn "$THEMES/apollo.vim" ~/.vim/colors/apollo.vim
# then in .vimrc:  colorscheme apollo

# Neovim (any nvim config — drop into a `colors/` on rtp)
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/colors
ln -sfn "$THEMES/apollo.nvim.lua" ~/.config/nvim/colors/apollo.lua
# then in init.lua:  vim.cmd('colorscheme apollo')

# WezTerm — already wired via wezterm/wezterm.lua (#11111b bg). To use
# the standalone scheme instead, in wezterm.lua:
#   local apollo = dofile(os.getenv("HOME") .. "/Public/dot-configs/themes/apollo/apollo.lua")
#   config.color_schemes = { Apollo = apollo }
#   config.color_scheme  = "Apollo"

# VS Code — local extension (NOT synced via Settings Sync; copy per machine)
EXT=~/.vscode/extensions/apollo-theme-0.0.1
mkdir -p "$EXT/themes"
cp "$THEMES/apollo-color-theme.json" "$EXT/themes/"
cat > "$EXT/package.json" <<'JSON'
{
  "name": "apollo-theme", "displayName": "Apollo", "version": "0.0.1",
  "publisher": "local", "engines": {"vscode": "^1.60.0"},
  "categories": ["Themes"],
  "contributes": {"themes": [{"label": "Apollo", "uiTheme": "vs-dark",
    "path": "./themes/apollo-color-theme.json"}]}
}
JSON
# then in VS Code settings.json:  "workbench.colorTheme": "Apollo"
# Reload window (⌘⇧P → Developer: Reload Window).

# Windows Terminal — paste themes/apollo/apollo.terminal.json into the
# "schemes" array in settings.json, then set "colorScheme": "Apollo"
# on the profile(s) you want.
```

### 9. Optional: tmux plugins

`install.sh` runs TPM bootstrap automatically. Verify:

```bash
ls ~/.tmux/plugins/ | head        # should list tpm + a handful of plugins
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf 2>&1 || echo "FAIL: tmux config error"
```

### 10. Smoke test — end to end

```bash
# Fresh shell so .zshrc/oh-my-zsh-custom are loaded.
zsh -l -c 'echo $SHELL; alias ls; type enable_proxy' \
  | grep -q "enable_proxy is a shell function" \
  && echo "shell ok" || echo "FAIL: oh-my-zsh-custom not loaded"

# Claude Code → proxy round-trip
claude --print "say 'hello from devbox'" 2>&1 | head -5
# Should print a model response. If it errors with connection refused,
# the proxy (step 6) isn't running.
```

If all 10 steps print `ok` (or the equivalent positive signal), the box is
fully set up. The `gg [title]` function, the statusline (5-line layout
with git/branch/cost/ctx/agents/skills segments), the dark-ansi Claude Code
theme, and the Catppuccin-aligned tmux/wezterm chrome are all live.

### Platform notes

- **macOS-only.** `install.sh` is the single supported installer.
- **The proxy must keep running** for Claude Code to function. Quitting
  the `copilot-relay start` process breaks every Claude Code session
  immediately; the launchd agent keeps it running and restarts it after
  crashes or updates.

## How to add a new config

| Goal | Where to add the file |
|---|---|
| New `~/.something` dotfile | Drop it at repo root as `.something`, then re-run `install.sh`. |
| New oh-my-zsh customization (alias, function, env) | Create a new `*.zsh` file in `oh-my-zsh-custom/`, then re-run `install.sh`. Files there are auto-loaded by oh-my-zsh in alphabetical order. |
| New Copilot CLI config | Drop the file under `copilot/`, then re-run `install.sh`. (`mcp-config.json` is gitignored because it contains secrets — manage that file manually.) |
| New Claude Code config | Drop the file under `claude/`, then re-run `install.sh`. The destination directory is created automatically. |
| New SonicTerm config | Drop TOML under `.sonicterm/`, `.sonicterm/keymaps/`, or `.sonicterm/themes/`, then re-run `install.sh`. Do not commit `logs/` or runtime backups. |
| copilot-relay config | Edit `.copilot-relay/config.yaml`, then re-run `install.sh` if the symlink is not already installed. Never commit `github_token`, `copilot_token.json`, or `logs/`. |
| Editing an existing config | Edit it in this repo. Symlinks make changes live immediately on every machine. Reload mechanisms: tmux `prefix + r`; wezterm auto-reloads. |

After adding/editing, commit and push. Other machines pick up the change with
`git pull` (and `install.sh` again only if new files were introduced).

## Included configs

### Shell (`oh-my-zsh-custom/`)

#### `custom.zsh`

- Aliases: `ls=eza`, `ll=eza -l`, `c=cd ..`, `vim=nvim`, `proxy/unproxy`.
- `enable_proxy` / `disable_proxy` functions: toggle SOCKS5 proxy at
  `127.0.0.1:46971` for shell env vars, git, and npm in one call.
- Uses Homebrew-installed `eza`, `neovim`, `autojump`,
  `zsh-fast-syntax-highlighting`, and `zsh-completions`.
- Repairs group/world-writable completion directories before running
  `compinit -i`, avoiding zsh's insecure-directory interactive prompt.
- Adds `.NET` and Android SDK tooling to `PATH`.

#### `copilot.zsh`

Wraps `copilot update`: after a successful update it runs
`~/.copilot/cleanup-legacy.sh`, so old `~/.copilot/pkg/<platform>/<version>`
payloads left by upgrades are pruned automatically.

#### `gg.zsh` — `gg [title]`

Sets the current terminal tab and window title to `[title]` via OSC 1 / 2
escape sequences (works in WezTerm, iTerm2, anything OSC-compliant). If
`title` is omitted, `gg` uses the current directory path so a bare session still
has a useful name.
**Inside tmux** the OSC escape doesn't propagate to the outer terminal because
`.tmux.conf` keeps `allow-rename off` and `automatic-rename off`, so `gg` also
calls `tmux rename-window` directly — that updates tmux's status-bar window
name, and `set-titles on` then bubbles `#S · #W` up to the outer terminal's
titlebar. After updating titles, `gg` launches
`copilot --allow-all-tools --allow-all-paths --model claude-opus-5 --context long_context --effort max` in the current
shell. Useful for labeling Copilot CLI sessions so they're identifiable in
the tab bar.

Implementation notes:

- Sends OSC 1 (icon name / tab title) and OSC 2 (window title) — terminals
  that pull the window title from the active surface's OSC 2 (WezTerm) pick
  this up automatically when not nested in tmux.
- Prepends a Nerd Font glyph (`fa-github`, U+F09B) to the title so Copilot
  tabs are visually distinct from plain shells / `cc` tabs at a glance.
  Requires a Nerd-patched font in the terminal — Rec Mono St.Helens (the
  default in this repo's `wezterm.lua`) is itself a Nerd Font 3.4.0 build
  so the glyph renders natively, no fallback needed.
- When `$TMUX` is set, also runs `tmux rename-window -- "$title"` so tmux's
  own window-name machinery is in sync (it doesn't read OSC sequences once
  `automatic-rename` is off).
- For WezTerm specifically (gated by `$WEZTERM_PANE`), also calls
  `wezterm cli set-tab-title` and `set-window-title` to update WezTerm's
  internal state — no-op when wezterm is on PATH but not the active terminal.
- Sets `DISABLE_AUTO_TITLE=true` while Copilot is running so oh-my-zsh's
  `precmd` / `preexec` hooks don't keep overwriting the title.
- Calls `command copilot ...` to bypass any shell alias of the same name.

### Terminal — WezTerm (`wezterm/`)

The terminal config is kept in-repo and auto-linked by `install.sh` to
`~/.wezterm.lua`.

Highlights of the in-repo config: `color_scheme = "Catppuccin Mocha"`, Rec Mono St.Helens, custom 5-row "floating tabs" with Nerd
Font process icons and a Knight-Rider loading bar for vibe-coding
sessions, DPI-adaptive font weight, FreeType fine-tuning, smart `Cmd+C`
(copy if selection else SIGINT), `inactive_pane_hsb = {1,1,1}` (no
dimming of inactive panes), and a tab-bar `BAR_BG` derived from the
active color scheme so swapping schemes auto-aligns the tab strip.

### Terminal — SonicTerm (`.sonicterm/`)

SonicTerm config is kept in-repo and auto-linked by `install.sh` into
`~/.sonicterm/`, but not as a whole-directory symlink. The installer links only
the tracked TOML files (`sonicterm.toml`, `keymaps/*.toml`, `themes/*.toml`) so
SonicTerm's `logs/` directory and runtime backup files remain local.

The tracked config uses the `catppuccin-mocha` theme, `sonicterm-macos` keymap,
Rec Mono St.Helens 14 with line-height 1.2, `TERM_PROGRAM=WezTerm`, 1000-line
scrollback, no cursor blink, opaque Catppuccin Mocha chrome, software render
mode auto, and WezTerm-compatible keymaps for macOS/Linux/Windows.

**Keeping the theme across upstream pulls.** This repo is a fork: `origin` is
this copy, `source` is upstream `D0n9X1n/dot-config`. Themes are split so the
two never collide:

| File | Owner | On `git pull source main` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `themes/wezterm.toml` | upstream (Gruvbox dark hard) | fast-forwards cleanly — kept byte-identical to `source/main` |
| `themes/catppuccin-mocha.toml` | this fork | untouched — upstream has no such file |
| `sonicterm.toml` | shared | only `theme =` differs; upstream's edits land elsewhere in the file and auto-merge |

SonicTerm resolves `theme = "catppuccin-mocha"` against
`~/.sonicterm/themes/<name>.toml`, so the rendered colors are unchanged. To pull
upstream: `git pull source main`. Do not merge the palette back into
`wezterm.toml`.

### copilot-relay (`.copilot-relay/`)

The relay config is kept in-repo and auto-linked by `install.sh` to
`~/.copilot-relay/config.yaml`. It is intentionally limited to secret-free
settings: local bind address/port, logging retention, `claudeSetup: false`,
`thinkEffort: max`, `gptModel: gpt-5.6-sol`, and
`opusModel: claude-opus-5`.

Do not commit the rest of `~/.copilot-relay/`: `github_token`,
`copilot_token.json`, and `logs/` are machine-local auth/runtime state.

### Terminal — tmux (`.tmux.conf`)

Primary tab/split/session manager. Linked to `~/.tmux.conf` by `install.sh`.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Theme | hand-rolled Catppuccin Mocha palette (matches WezTerm) |
| Prefix | `C-q` (chosen over default C-b for ergonomics — far from C-c/d/z, doesn't clash with readline, modern macOS disables the legacy C-q XON flow control so nothing reclaims the keystroke; press `prefix + C-q` to send a literal `C-q` to the active pane) |
| `default-terminal` | `tmux-256color` + `RGB` overrides for `wezterm`, `xterm-256color`, `*-direct`; `terminal-features … :RGB` so tmux 3.2+ actually advertises truecolor (without it tmux silently downsamples to the 256-color cube) |
| Env scrubbing | `set-environment -gu TERMINFO TERMINFO_DIRS TERMCAP TERM_PROGRAM TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` + `set -g COLORTERM truecolor` — defends against long-lived tmux servers inheriting dead `$TERMINFO` from previously installed terminals (which otherwise silently degrades panes from `tmux-256color` to `xterm-color` and breaks Copilot CLI's truecolor input panel). **Recovery for an already-poisoned server**: save state with `prefix + Ctrl-s`, then `tmux kill-server` from a non-tmux shell. |
| Mouse | `on` (scroll, click-to-select, drag-to-resize) |
| `escape-time` | `0` (vim-friendly) |
| `history-limit` | `100000` |
| Window/pane base index | `1` (1-indexed; `renumber-windows on`) |
| Status position | top |
| Set-clipboard | `on` (OSC 52 — works through SSH because WezTerm honours OSC 52) |
| Mode keys | `vi` |
| Allow rename / Auto rename | `off` (so `gg` / Vim-buffer titles stick; `gg` calls `tmux rename-window` explicitly) |

Keybinds (additive — tmux defaults like `prefix + n / p / 1..9 / Tab` for
window nav, `prefix + z` for zoom, `prefix + Space` for layout cycle, `prefix
+ d` for detach, `prefix + s` for session list are all kept):

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Reload tmux.conf | `prefix + r` |
| Split right (vertical separator) | `prefix + |` (cwd inherited) |
| Split down (horizontal separator) | `prefix + -` (cwd inherited) |
| New window (cwd inherited) | `prefix + c` (default rebound to inherit cwd) |
| Pane focus (vim-style) | `prefix + h / j / k / l` |
| Pane resize (repeatable, no re-prefix) | `prefix + H / J / K / L` |
| Copy mode (vi keys) | `prefix + v`, then `v` start-selection, `y` copy |
| Mouse drag selection | auto-copies on drag end (OSC 52) |

Status bar segments:

- **Left**: yellow pill with the current session name (`#S`).
- **Window list**: inactive in dim grey on bg0; active in dark text on a
  Catppuccin blue pill, plus a magnifier when zoomed
  (`#{?window_zoomed_flag, ,}`).
- **Right**: prefix indicator (only while the prefix is held, in red),
  `HH:MM`, vertical bar, and `YYYY-MM-DD`.

Plugins (managed by **TPM** — bootstrap is automatic on first run, both via
`.tmux.conf`'s `if "test ! -d ..."` guard and via `install.sh`):

| Plugin | Why |
|---|---|
| `tmux-plugins/tpm` | Plugin manager |
| `tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible` | Opinionated defaults that don't fight ours |
| `tmux-plugins/tmux-yank` | Cross-platform clipboard helpers |
| `tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect` | Save/restore sessions (`prefix + Ctrl-s` / `Ctrl-r`); pane contents and Vim/NeoVim sessions captured |
| `tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum` | Auto-save every 5 min, auto-restore on tmux start |

> **Validate locally** with
> `tmux -f .tmux.conf -L _v new-session -d -s _v ; tmux -L _v kill-server`
> — silent exit means the config parsed cleanly. To force re-install of
> plugins: `~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/bin/install_plugins`.

### Copilot CLI (`copilot/`)

Files in `copilot/` are linked into `~/.copilot/`. `install.sh` creates the
destination directory when missing, preserves executable bits on shell scripts,
and then runs `cleanup-legacy.sh` when the Copilot CLI is available.

#### `settings.json`

Copilot CLI configuration. Pinned model `claude-opus-5`,
`contextTier: long_context` (1M context), `effortLevel: max`, theme `dark`,
`keepAlive: busy`,
`continueOnAutoMode: true`, custom footer, and a custom status line provided
by `statusline.sh`. The `hooks` block wires `sessionStart`, `sessionEnd`,
`subagentStart`, and `subagentStop` to `~/.copilot/subagent-state.sh` so live
subagent rows are maintained without scanning the session event log on every
statusline redraw.

> **Caveat:** Copilot CLI rewrites `settings.json` at runtime to inject /
> strip a `staff` field and to toggle UI defaults — edit it via atomic
> read–mutate–write–commit. Inside the `statusLine` block only the single
> `padding` field is honored (`paddingTop` / `paddingLeft` / etc. are
> silently ignored); per-side spacing is emitted from inside `statusline.sh`
> instead.

#### `statusline.sh`

Executable script — a "full mirror" of `~/.claude/statusline.sh` adapted to
Copilot's `statusLine` JSON. Per-segment Catppuccin color accents and
color-graded Context %. Default layout is five lines: L1 time/run/req/wakatime,
L2 model/effort/context, L3 mcp/skills/agents/tasks/style, L4 cwd path, L5
repo/branch/diff/stash/worktree. The default icon accent lattice avoids using
the same color for adjacent segments or for segments in the same visual column.
Copilot-only segments such as `api`, `cache_pct`, `last_call`, `gh_account`,
`ext_count`, and `venv` remain available via `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_SEGMENTS`.

Environment overrides:

- `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_NO_ICONS=1` — drop icons, keep text labels.
- `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_NO_COLOR=1` — drop color (legacy
  `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_NO_DIM=1` is honored as an alias for backwards-compat).
- `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_PAD_TOP=N` / `..._PAD_LEFT=N` / `..._PAD_RIGHT=N` —
  override per-side padding (defaults: top = 0, left = 0, right = 0).
- `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_SEGMENTS="…"` — override the segment list and order
  (e.g. add `diff`, drop `cache_pct`, reorder freely).
- `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_SUBAGENT_STATE_DIR=dir` — override the hook-maintained
  subagent rows directory (defaults to `$TMPDIR/copilot-subagents-$USER`).

Run `~/.copilot/statusline.sh --test` to verify each codepoint renders in
your terminal (uses `fc-list` if installed). Parses Copilot's session JSON
from stdin via a single `jq` call, caches git state for 5s
(`COPILOT_STATUSLINE_GIT_TTL=N` overrides), and caches `gh auth status` for
5 minutes. Bash 3.2-compatible. `install.sh` keeps the executable bit set.

> **Perf (v0.6.0):** the sibling `claude/statusline.sh` was rewritten for
> warm-cache latency 125ms → 18ms — pure-bash JSON parsing (no `jq`
> dependency), per-cwd git state cached for 5s under
> `$TMPDIR/claude-statusline-cache-$USER/git-<hash>`, awk forks dropped
> in favour of bash printf / arithmetic for `cost`/`ctx`/`fmt_tokens`,
> and `printf -v __SEG` replaces the per-segment `$(seg_$s)` subshell
> capture. `copilot/statusline.sh` tracks the same shape.

> **Layout (v0.13.x):** five-line layout by default. Literal `\n` tokens
> in the `SEGMENTS` list introduce line breaks:
> L1 `time | run | req | wakatime`, L2 `model | effort | context`,
> L3 `mcp | skills | agents | tasks | style`, L4 cwd path, L5
> `repo | branch | diff | stash | worktree`. `seg_path` (icon U+F07C
> folder-open) renders the full cwd with `$HOME` collapsed to `~`.
> `seg_agent` counts local custom agent profiles (`*.md` in
> `~/.copilot/agents/` + `<cwd>/.github/agents/`), and `seg_skills` counts
> skill bundles (`SKILL.md` under `~/.copilot/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`,
> `<cwd>/.github/skills/`, `<cwd>/.claude/skills/`, and
> `<cwd>/.agents/skills/`) — i.e. **available definitions**, not live
> sub-agents. `seg_subagents` shows the live running-subagent count. When
> active subagent rows are shown below L5, they are preceded by a
> `----------------------------------------` separator. The root `main` row uses
> a terminal icon, and subagent rows use a magic-wand icon (U+F0D0). Those rows come from
> `subagent-state.sh`'s small per-session rows file first, with a
> signature-cached `events.jsonl` fallback if hook rows are missing.
> `seg_timer` shows `Nh Mm` once the session crosses one hour (v0.13.2).
> Override per-shell via
> `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_SEGMENTS`.

#### `subagent-state.sh`

Executable Copilot hook helper. `sessionStart` / `sessionEnd` reset the
per-session rows file; `subagentStart` appends `toolCallId`, `agentDisplayName`,
purpose, and start time; `subagentStop` removes by `toolCallId` first, then
falls back to FIFO by agent name/display name.

#### `cleanup-legacy.sh`

Executable upgrade-cleanup hook. It detects the current Copilot CLI version via
`copilot --version`, keeps only that package under
`~/.copilot/pkg/<platform>/<version>`, removes older package payloads, empty
package dirs, `.DS_Store`, root `*.bak.*` files, and all but the newest
`logs/process-*.log`. `install.sh` runs it after linking Copilot files; the
`oh-my-zsh-custom/copilot.zsh` wrapper runs it after every successful
`copilot update`.

#### `copilot-instructions.md`

Global agent instructions — autonomous mode (no per-action confirmation):
operate in plan / exec cycles and verify before claiming completion.

### Claude Code (`claude/`)

Files in `claude/` are linked into `~/.claude/`. Bridges Anthropic's
[Claude Code CLI](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) to GitHub
Copilot models via a local [`copilot-relay`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copilot-relay)
proxy that translates Anthropic-format requests into Copilot ones.

#### `settings.json`

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:4142",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "dummy",
    "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "claude-opus-5[1m]",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL": "gpt-5.6-sol[1m]",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL": "gpt-5.6-sol[1m]",
    "ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL": "gpt-5.6-sol[1m]",
    "MODEL_REASONING_EFFORT": "max"
  },
  "permissions": { "allow": ["*"], "defaultMode": "auto" },
  "model": "claude-opus-5[1m]",
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/statusline.sh",
    "padding": 0,
    "refreshInterval": 100
  },
  "effortLevel": "max",
  "theme": "dark-ansi",
  "skipAutoPermissionPrompt": true,
  "skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt": true
}
```

Defaults pinned globally (synced across machines via this repo):

- **Model: `claude-opus-5[1m]`** (default). The `[1m]` suffix keeps Claude Code's
  1M-context accounting — a bare custom name would
  be treated as 200k. `copilot-relay` matches on the `opus` substring and
  ignores the suffix, mapping the request to Copilot upstream
  `opusModel: claude-opus-5`, so the Claude-facing label is cosmetic
  relay-side. `env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, top-level `model`, and the zsh wrappers are
  all pinned to `claude-opus-5[1m]`.
- **The GPT route stays configured.** It is reachable via `/model` or
  `--model 'gpt-5.6-sol[1m]'`, and every Sonnet/Haiku/small-fast alias still
  uses it. `copilot-relay` sends every model name that does **not** contain
  `opus` to `gptModel` (currently `gpt-5.6-sol`), also at max effort and 1M
  Claude-side accounting.
- **Family-aware routing via env vars + relay**:
  - **`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL: gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`** — every Sonnet alias
    from Claude Code's built-in picker uses the GPT route while preserving
    Claude-side 1M context accounting.
  - **`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL: gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`** — Haiku tier for current
    Claude Code versions, including sub-agents and small-fast side tasks.
  - **`ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL: gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`** — legacy alias for older
    Claude Code versions.
  - `copilot-relay` routes every alias above to the
    same upstream `gptModel` (`gpt-5.6-sol`), so the Claude-facing label only
    affects Claude-side display/accounting. Plain unsuffixed names work too,
    but Claude Code treats unknown custom model names as 200k.
- **Effort: `max`** — applied two ways:
  `effortLevel: "max"` (Claude Code's client-side reasoning budget,
  applied to every session) and `thinkEffort: max` in
  `~/.copilot-relay/config.yaml` (linked by `install.sh`, hot-reloaded by
  the relay, and forwarded to Copilot upstream). `MODEL_REASONING_EFFORT`
  remains in `settings.json` so the statusline can display the pinned effort.
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` — the local `copilot-relay` proxy on port 4142.
  All model names above are Copilot-side identifiers the proxy knows how
  to route. Claude Code itself doesn't know about `gpt-5.6-sol`; the proxy
  translates every request and replies with Anthropic-shaped JSON.
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` — required by Claude Code's startup check.
  `dummy` is fine; real auth happens in `npx copilot-relay auth`.
- `skipAutoPermissionPrompt: true` + `permissions.defaultMode: "auto"` —
  autonomous mode by default (no per-action confirmation). Note: the
  binary explicitly **rejects** `defaultMode: "bypassPermissions"`
  ("bypassPermissions mode is disabled by settings"), so for full
  bypass we wrap the launchers — see "Wrappers" below.
- `editorMode`: not pinned. `statusLine.refreshInterval: 100` drops the
  redraw cadence so the statusline updates feel snappy.
- `theme: "dark-ansi"` lets the chrome inherit the terminal's ANSI palette
  (so it tracks the WezTerm Catppuccin scheme rather than hard-coding its
  own colors).

#### Native concurrent-subagent limit

`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS=16` configures Claude Code's built-in
per-session limit (v2.1.217+). When 16 subagents are running, another Claude-
spawned `Agent` call fails with `Concurrent subagent limit reached`; admission
reopens when the running count drops. `install.sh` accepts an already-current
CLI, uses the Homebrew cask only when necessary, and refuses to complete the
Homebrew setup path if
the installed CLI still cannot satisfy v2.1.217.

This adopts Claude Code's documented native semantics rather than preserving an
absolute fail-closed hook. A user-started `/subtask` occupies a slot but is not
blocked, resuming a finished subagent can push the count above 16, and ultracode
sessions are exempt. Workflow agents and agent-team teammates follow their own
limits. The former `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`SubagentStop` hook chain, `jq`
payload parsing, locks, and per-session state files have been removed.

#### `statusline.sh`

Executable Claude Code statusline with the same five-line layout as the Copilot
statusline. Unlike the Copilot sibling, it renders **no** subagent rows — Claude
Code ships its own native subagent UI, so the inline `subagents` count and the
live-agent tree below L5 were removed (intentional divergence). Concurrent
admission is handled natively by Claude Code; the statusline needs no hook
state.

#### Wrappers (`oh-my-zsh-custom/claude.zsh`, `cc.zsh`)

Bare `claude` is wrapped as a shell function that always passes
`--permission-mode bypassPermissions`. The CLI flag is the only path
the binary honors for non-interactive bypass — the equivalent
settings.json key is gated off by feature flag.

Same applies to `cc [title]`: it renames the active terminal tab via
OSC 1/2 (+ tmux + WezTerm CLI fallbacks; default title is the current directory
path) then launches Claude Code with
the bypass flag plus `--model 'claude-opus-5[1m]' --effort max`. The title is prefixed with a Nerd Font glyph
(`mdi-creation`, U+F0674 — sparkles) so Claude tabs are visually distinct
from Copilot's `gg` tabs (which use `fa-github`) and from plain shells.

To switch models mid-session, use Claude Code's `/model <name>` —
free-form names pass through the proxy unchanged.

One-time setup (after running `install.sh` on a fresh box):

```bash
npx copilot-relay auth  # browser device-code login (GitHub)
claude              # in another shell — uses claude-opus-5 1M @ max effort
```

Project-specific Claude Code config is synced by committing files to each
project repo (`.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and `.mcp.json`).
`install.sh` intentionally does **not** copy per-project state from
`~/.claude.json`: that file is machine-local, path-keyed, and can include trust,
OAuth, cache, and local MCP state. The only `~/.claude.json` mutation here is the
safe user-scope MCP import from Copilot's MCP file.

> **Caveat:** Claude Code rewrites `settings.json` at runtime to add fields
> like `firstStartTime`, telemetry IDs, etc. Same atomic
> read–mutate–write–commit pattern as Copilot CLI's `settings.json`. If a
> spurious diff appears in the working tree, restore the committed shape
> rather than committing the runtime addition.

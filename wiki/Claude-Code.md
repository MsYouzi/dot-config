# Claude Code

English | [简体中文](Claude-Code-zh-CN.md)

Claude Code uses a local copilot-relay service in this setup.

    C[Claude Code] --> R[127.0.0.1:4142]
    R --> G[GitHub Copilot]
```

The source files are under `config/claude/`. They install under `~/.claude/`.

## One-time setup

```sh
./install.sh
npx copilot-relay auth
./install.sh
```

The first Claude Code launch asks if the custom `dummy` API key is allowed. Choose yes. The value is a placeholder required by Claude Code. copilot-relay owns the real GitHub login.

## Model routing

The tracked default is:

```text
Claude-facing name: claude-sonnet-5[1m]
Picker name:        native Sonnet name
Saved Sonnet effort: max
Launcher effort:     max
Relay route:        gptModel
Upstream model:     gpt-6-astra
```

Claude Code keeps its native client identity. The name has no `opus`, so copilot-relay sends it to `gptModel`.

Other routes:

| Claude-facing name | Relay lane | Upstream |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-opus-5[1m]` | `opusModel` | `claude-opus-5` |
| `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (Haiku / small-fast) | `gptModel` | `gpt-6-astra` |

Client names and upstream models are separate layers. The client keeps native Anthropic ids; the relay decides the upstream model. Do not write a GPT id, or a `_NAME` / `_DESCRIPTION` display override, into Claude-facing settings.

The `[1m]` suffix keeps Claude Code's one-million-token model context accounting; the relay sends canonical `gpt-6-astra` upstream. The Haiku id is the installed CLI's own small-fast id and takes no `[1m]` suffix. Automatic compaction is expected at 750,000 tokens on the default Sonnet path, below Astra's advertised 872,000-token prompt limit within its 1M total window. This does not retain a full 1M-token conversation history. Relay-side default thinking is `max` in `config/copilot-relay/config.yaml`; the saved Sonnet preference and shell launchers also use `max`.

Use a relay build with GPT-6 Astra support before relying on this setup (tracked in [copilot-relay issue #57](https://github.com/D0n9X1n/copilot-relay/issues/57)). Update model or effort defaults in `config/claude/settings.json`, `config/zsh/claude.zsh`, and `config/zsh/cc.zsh` together; the wrappers' `--model` and `--effort` flags override the settings. The relay's `gptModel` stays suffix-free. Its blank `webSearchBackend` also uses Astra. Keep the Opus route separate.

Run `copilot` and enter `/model` to check account availability and effort choices before changing models. That is Copilot's picker, not Claude Code's picker or the relay's local `/v1/models`. After `scripts/check.sh all` passes, apply through `./install.sh` twice and start a new shell and Claude Code session. The installer leaves a healthy relay running; recovery of an unhealthy relay may interrupt requests.

The Sonnet-facing slot routes to GPT-6 Astra through `gptModel`; Opus stays on its separate `opusModel` route. Do not change both routes when a task names only one.

## Main settings

`config/claude/settings.json` sets:

| Key | Value or job |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:4142` |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | local placeholder `dummy` |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5[1m]` |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5[1m]` |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| `model` | `sonnet`; the picker's own short alias |
| `modelSettings.claude-sonnet-5.effortLevel` | `max`; Sonnet's saved effort preference |
| `MODEL_REASONING_EFFORT` | `max`; status-line fallback aligned with the launchers' `--effort max` |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS` | `20` |
| `statusLine.refreshInterval` | `100` |
| `theme` | `custom:apollo`; generated theme assets stay local |
| `autoCompactEnabled` | `true` |
| `autoCompactWindow` | `770000` before the output-token reserve |
| `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` | `"100"`; targets compaction at 750,000 tokens with the default Sonnet output budget |
| `feedbackDrafts` | `off` |

`refreshInterval` belongs inside `statusLine`. Keep the Sonnet `modelSettings` preference, `MODEL_REASONING_EFFORT`, and both launchers aligned at `max`; their explicit `--effort` flags override the saved preference unless you supply another effort flag. No top-level `effortLevel` is managed. `max` is the shared reasoning-effort default for Claude Code and [Copilot CLI](Copilot-CLI.md), not a model name.

### 750k automatic-compaction target

The configured window is not the compaction trigger. Claude Code 2.1.261 subtracts its output-token reserve before applying the percentage. With the default native Sonnet output reserve, the selected settings calculate to `(770000 - 20000) × 100% = 750000`.

This calculation gives an effective window of 750,000 tokens and an expected trigger of 750,000 tokens; it is not a fresh runtime measurement. This is a trigger, not a hard transcript-size cap; a turn can cross it before compaction runs. Other CLI versions, models, output budgets, or `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` overrides can change the calculation. Start a new Claude Code session after editing the source settings.

`~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.claude.json` are different files:

- `settings.json` is linked config, including the `custom:apollo` theme preference.
- `~/.claude.json` is local state. It holds onboarding, API-key approval, the installer's matching Apollo theme selection, project data, and imported MCP servers.

`install.sh` generates `~/.claude/themes/apollo.json` from the verified canonical Apollo release and preserves every unrelated field when it selects `custom:apollo`. The generated theme is local state, not a Git source.

Do not put the local state file in Git.

## Deterministic cleanup

The `claude` and `cc` wrappers launch the real CLI through `~/.claude/session-cleanup.sh`. Each invocation receives a private mode-0700 root under `/tmp/claude-code-<uid>-cleanup/roots/`. Lifecycle hooks clear only that validated root: `SessionStart` exposes its `tools/` directory as `TMPDIR`, `Stop` closes Playwright and clears turn files, `StopFailure` performs best-effort turn cleanup, and `SessionEnd` plus the launcher trap perform final cleanup.

Playwright MCP runs through `~/.claude/playwright-mcp.sh`, pinned to `0.0.79` with `--isolated`. A JSON-RPC proxy avoids launching Chromium for an idle `browser_close` hook and keeps generated output inside the owned root. Browser binaries under `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` are preserved. Ownership, token, UID, mode, and symlink validation prevent deleting another session or arbitrary paths. Read-only inventory:

```sh
~/.claude/session-cleanup.sh inventory
```

The cleanup scripts are tracked under `scripts/claude/` and installed through `config/manifest.tsv`. Browser-operation generations keep an older close response from hiding a newer navigation; the final close still reaches Playwright.

## Global instructions

`config/claude/CLAUDE.md` installs as `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and sets user-wide response style. Conversational prose is direct and concise by default. Requests for more detail still win, and code, commands, findings, evidence, caveats, safety information, and technical precision stay complete.

The global file holds only reusable behavior plus one conditional pointer: these settings are synced from `~/Public/dot-configs`, and a change to them starts by reading that folder's `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Repo-only rules — the Wiki source of truth, the manifest, checks, bilingual pages — stay in this repo's own `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, so an unrelated project never loads them.

After a PR merges, the global rules require local cleanup before the task is called complete: confirm the merge, remove clean inactive PR worktrees and local branches, prune stale references, remove task-created temporary files, and stop unneeded task-owned processes. Preserve uncommitted or unmerged work, stashes, active sessions and locks, unrelated files, and shared processes. Verify the final state and report anything kept. This is an agent instruction, not an unattended merge hook.

## Launch wrappers

`config/zsh/claude.zsh` wraps `claude` and adds:

```text
--permission-mode bypassPermissions
--model claude-sonnet-5[1m]
--effort max
```

An explicit `--model`, `--model=`, `--effort`, or `--effort=` on the command line suppresses the matching default; the other default still applies.

The binary rejects `permissions.defaultMode: bypassPermissions` in settings. The command-line flag works. The wrapper also pins model and effort because Claude Code can rewrite settings at runtime.

Because `settings.json` is a symlink, CLI-persisted preferences can appear as source changes. Review `git diff -- config/claude/settings.json` before committing, reconcile only the changed keys with the supported settings above, and rerun `scripts/check.sh all`. Do not restore the whole file and lose other intentional edits.

`cc [title]` sets the SonicTerm title, renames the RMUX window when present, and starts Claude Code with the same defaults.

Use `rmux claude` only when Claude Code should create agent-team panes. RMUX gives that process a private tmux-compatible shim. No global tmux shim is installed.

## Agent limit

Claude Code v2.1.217 or later is required.

The native admission value is 20. It is not a hard global ceiling:

- a user-started `/subtask` uses a slot but is not blocked by the same boundary;
- a resumed agent can pass the configured count;
- ultracode is exempt;
- workflow agents and team workers use separate limits.

Do not restore the old lifecycle counter hook.

## Status line

Claude and Copilot status lines share the same five-line shape, locally generated Apollo colors, and five-second per-directory Git cache:

1. time, run time, cost, WakaTime
2. model, effort, context
3. MCP, skills, agents, style
4. current path
5. repo, branch, diff, stash, worktree

Both scripts source the same generated Apollo color include. If it is missing or color is disabled, they remain readable without colors. Claude's custom status line has no live-subagent count or tree because Claude Code has native subagent UI. Copilot keeps the custom rows.

## Plugins

The tracked settings enable:

- `frontend-design@claude-plugins-official`
- `rust-analyzer-lsp@claude-plugins-official`
- `clangd-lsp@claude-plugins-official`
- `swift-lsp@claude-plugins-official`
- `claude-code-wakatime@wakatime`

The WakaTime marketplace points to the official `wakatime/claude-code-wakatime` Git repository.

## Common fixes

### Claude asks for onboarding every time

`hasCompletedOnboarding` is missing from local `~/.claude.json`. Complete onboarding once on that Mac.

### The `dummy` key is rejected

The first prompt was answered no. In local `~/.claude.json`, move `dummy` from `customApiKeyResponses.rejected` to `approved`, or complete the approval flow again.

### Small jobs get `model_not_supported`

Keep both the Haiku and small-fast aliases set to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, the installed CLI's own small-fast id. Do not add a `[1m]` suffix there. Also check the relay base URL.

### Relay rewrites settings

`claudeSetup` must be `false` in `config/copilot-relay/config.yaml`. Run `./install.sh` again.

### Relay token expired

```sh
npx copilot-relay auth
./install.sh
```

A deep relay check that exits with code 2 normally needs login again, not a restart.

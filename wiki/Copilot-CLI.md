# Copilot CLI

English | [简体中文](Copilot-CLI-zh-CN.md)

Copilot CLI files live under `config/copilot/`. They install under `~/.copilot/`.

## Defaults

`config/copilot/settings.json` uses:

```text
model:       gpt-6-astra
context:     long_context
effort:      max
permissions: allow-all
theme:       default (terminal Base-16)
keep alive:  busy
streaming:   on
```

Run `copilot`, then enter `/model` inside its interactive session to see your account's available models and their effort choices. Astra advertises `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`; availability depends on the account and organization policy. The CLI uses canonical `gpt-6-astra`, without Claude Code's `[1m]` suffix.

To change the managed model, context, or effort defaults, edit `config/copilot/settings.json` and the matching `--model`, `--context`, or `--effort` flag in `config/zsh/gg.zsh` together, then run `scripts/check.sh all`. For an unmanaged installation, `/config model` changes the Copilot user default; here, edit the tracked sources so the next install does not undo your choice.

The custom footer hides built-in fields and runs `~/.copilot/statusline.sh`.

Copilot can add or remove a `staff` field at runtime. Keep that field out of the tracked file. In `statusLine`, only the simple `padding` field is supported. Per-side spacing belongs in the shell script.

## Global instructions

`config/copilot/copilot-instructions.md` installs as `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md`. Copilot loads this native user-global file automatically.

It makes conversational prose direct and concise by default. Requests for more detail still win; code, commands, findings, evidence, caveats, safety information, and technical precision stay complete. It also keeps the working rules: run tools and commands without asking, and work on the task directly.

The file holds reusable behavior and a conditional pointer to `~/Public/dot-configs`. Changes to these managed settings start by reading that folder's `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Repo-only rules stay there, so unrelated projects do not load them.

No duplicate global `AGENTS.md` or shell-injected instruction directory is needed. Any user-supplied `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS` value stays untouched.

After a PR merges, the global rules require local cleanup before the task is called complete: confirm the merge, remove clean inactive PR worktrees and local branches, prune stale references, remove task-created temporary files, and stop unneeded task-owned processes. Preserve uncommitted or unmerged work, stashes, active sessions and locks, unrelated files, and shared processes. Verify the final state and report anything kept. This is an agent instruction, not an unattended merge hook.

## GitHub access

Copilot's built-in `github-mcp-server` uses its existing GitHub login. No separate GitHub MCP entry or PAT is needed for this setup. Claude uses authenticated `gh`; see [Repository operations](Repository-Operations.md) for other MCP servers.

## Terminal identity

SonicTerm and RMUX use their real terminal names. Copilot does not know every RMUX or SonicTerm capability path.

The `copilot` wrapper and `gg` start only the Copilot child with:

```text
TERM_PROGRAM=WezTerm
COLORTERM=truecolor
FORCE_COLOR=3
```

This turns on Copilot's supported terminal path. The managed `default` theme uses the terminal's Base-16 colors, so it inherits SonicTerm's Apollo ANSI palette. It does not install or run WezTerm. Other programs still see `SonicTerm` or `rmux`.

## Launch commands

```sh
copilot          # allow-all / YOLO Copilot alias
gg my-project    # titled, unrestricted Copilot session
```

The managed `copilot` alias calls a helper that adds `--yolo` and forwards your arguments unchanged. `gg` also passes `--yolo`. This is identical to `--allow-all`, or `--allow-all-tools --allow-all-paths --allow-all-urls`: tools, paths, and URLs do not ask for approval. No default flags need to be typed. Explicit deny rules and organization policy still apply.

`settings.json` also sets `defaultPermissionMode: "allow-all"` for new interactive sessions launched without the alias. The alias covers resumed sessions and `-p` runs too. This changes permissions, not autopilot mode. GPT-6 Astra, long context, and max effort are the defaults; `gg` also pins them at launch. `max` is the shared reasoning-effort default with [Claude Code](Claude-Code.md), not a model name. For a one-off override, use `copilot --effort <level>`; `gg` arguments are a title, not CLI flags.

Open a new shell after installation, or reload both launchers in the current shell:

```sh
source ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/copilot.zsh
source ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/gg.zsh
```

Remove any later `alias copilot=...` from `~/.zshrc`; it would override the managed alias after oh-my-zsh loads. In particular, the old tools-and-paths-only alias omits URL permissions and bypasses the terminal wrapper and update cleanup. The installer does not edit `~/.zshrc`.

`gg` sends OSC title codes to SonicTerm. Inside RMUX, it also runs `rmux rename-window`. It does not call tmux or the WezTerm CLI.

## Status line

The Copilot status line shares the five-line layout and locally generated Apollo colors with Claude:

1. time, run time, requests, WakaTime
2. model, effort, context
3. MCP, skills, agents, tasks, style
4. current path
5. repo, branch, diff, stash, worktree

It reads session JSON with one `jq` call. Both provider status scripts source the same generated Apollo color include and fall back to readable uncolored output when it is absent. Git data is cached for five seconds per working directory. GitHub auth data is cached for five minutes.

Copilot uses one extra color role from that shared include. Model, Effort, Path, and Branch print their values in the bright foreground role, so the identity of the session stands out from ordinary values. Their labels keep accent roles: Model is yellow, Path is aqua, Run is purple. Ordinary segment separators and the context capacity suffix use the dim foreground role rather than the plain dim attribute. The live-subagent rows and their separator are unchanged. Claude's status line does not use the bright role, so the shared generator does not change it.

Useful environment switches:

| Variable | Work |
|---|---|
| `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_NO_ICONS=1` | Hide icons |
| `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_NO_COLOR=1` | Hide colors |
| `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_PAD_TOP=N` | Add top space |
| `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_PAD_LEFT=N` | Add left space |
| `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_PAD_RIGHT=N` | Add right space |
| `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_SEGMENTS="..."` | Set segment order |
| `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_GIT_TTL=N` | Set Git cache seconds |
| `COPILOT_STATUSLINE_MAX_SUBAGENTS=N` | Limit live rows |

Run the glyph test:

```sh
~/.copilot/statusline.sh --test
```

## Live subagents

Copilot keeps custom live-subagent UI. Hooks call `~/.copilot/subagent-state.sh`:

- session start/end resets rows;
- subagent start adds a row;
- subagent stop removes the matching row.

The status line reads hook rows first. It can use the session event log when rows are missing.

Claude's sibling status line does not copy this part because Claude Code has native agent UI.

## Cleanup

`scripts/copilot/cleanup-legacy.sh` installs as `~/.copilot/cleanup-legacy.sh`.

It keeps the current Copilot package payload, removes old payloads, removes old backup files, and keeps only the newest process log. `install.sh` runs it after linking. A successful `copilot update` runs it too.

## WakaTime

`install.sh` installs or updates the official plugin:

```text
wakatime/copilot-cli-wakatime
```

It uses the API key from `~/.wakatime.cfg`. The plugin manages its own WakaTime CLI.

The installer removes the old WakaTime MCP, old Homebrew `wakatime-cli`, and old third-party npm plugin when found.

## Check

```sh
copilot --version
copilot plugin list
~/.copilot/statusline.sh --test
scripts/check.sh instructions
scripts/check.sh all
```

See [SonicTerm and shell](SonicTerm-and-Shell.md) for wrapper and title details.

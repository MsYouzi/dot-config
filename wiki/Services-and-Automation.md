# Services and automation

English | [简体中文](Services-and-Automation-zh-CN.md)

`install.sh` sets up tools, local services, shared MCP data, WakaTime, and cleanup jobs.

Copilot uses its built-in GitHub integration; Claude uses authenticated `gh`. No extra GitHub MCP entry or PAT is needed. See [Repository operations](Repository-Operations.md) for shared MCP data and local-secret boundaries.

## New Mac setup

On macOS, the installer can add:

- Homebrew
- RMUX
- Claude Code from the Homebrew cask
- Copilot CLI and copilot-relay from npm
- oh-my-zsh
- shell tools such as `eza`, `jq`, `neovim`, and autojump
- Recursive and Nerd fonts
- RecMono Baker and St.Helens fonts from the MOSconfig release
- checksum-pinned Apollo release inputs with fork-owned Catppuccin adapters for SonicTerm, RMUX, and eza
- local Catppuccin adapters for Claude, both status lines, and the shell prompt

The required Claude Code version is v2.1.217 or later. eza v0.23.5 or later is required for `theme.yml`.

Use these switches to skip slow setup work:

```sh
SKIP_BREW=1 ./install.sh
SKIP_NPM_GLOBALS=1 ./install.sh
SKIP_OH_MY_ZSH=1 ./install.sh
```

The install log is `~/Library/Logs/dot-configs-install.log`.

## Apollo release bundle

`scripts/apollo-releases.tsv` pins exact upstream tags and SHA-256 values. The fork then applies tracked Catppuccin inputs from `scripts/theme/`. The installer reuses verified local blobs, builds all files under one bundle hash derived from the release lock, adapter code, and fork theme inputs, and changes the `current` symlink only after the complete set validates. A second install uses the existing bundle without downloading or rewriting it.

A first install needs network access. Later installs work offline while the pinned blobs remain under `~/.local/share/dot-configs/apollo/`. A failed download or checksum keeps the previous bundle active. See [Apollo theme](Apollo-Theme.md).

## copilot-relay

The relay listens on:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4142
```

The tracked config is `config/copilot-relay/config.yaml`. It installs as `~/.copilot-relay/config.yaml`.

Important values:

```yaml
claudeSetup: false
thinkEffort: max
upstreamTimeoutSeconds: 600
gptModel: gpt-6-astra
opusModel: claude-opus-5
```

`claudeSetup: false` stops the relay from rewriting the linked Claude settings. The relay fallback is `max` for requests that omit effort. Claude's saved Sonnet preference and launchers use `max`, as do Copilot CLI's settings and `gg` launcher; explicit client effort takes precedence over the relay fallback. `upstreamTimeoutSeconds: 600` allows up to ten minutes for a single Claude request's upstream Copilot calls.

Login once:

```sh
npx copilot-relay auth
./install.sh
```

Auth and logs stay local under `~/.copilot-relay/`.

## launchd files

Files under `config/launchd/` are templates. They are not symlinks.

The installer replaces:

```text
__HOME__      with the home path
__REPO_ROOT__ with the repo path
```

It writes the result under `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`, then runs `bootout` and `bootstrap` for `gui/<uid>`.

Do not edit the rendered files. The next install will replace them.

## Relay service

`com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay` starts the relay at login. It starts again after a crash, with a ten-second throttle.

Check it:

```sh
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay"
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay"
```

Logs:

```text
~/Library/Logs/copilot-relay.out.log
~/Library/Logs/copilot-relay.err.log
~/.copilot-relay/logs/copilot-relay.log
```

## Relay health check

`com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay-healthcheck` runs at load and every 60 seconds.

It has two checks:

1. `GET /healthz` on every run. A non-200 result restarts the relay.
2. `copilot-relay status --deep` every 900 seconds. This sends a real request through Copilot.

A 200 from `/healthz` only means a socket is listening. The deep check also tests auth and upstream access.

Deep result:

| Exit | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Relay works | Do nothing |
| `1` | Relay is not running | Restart it |
| `2` | Relay listens but cannot reach Copilot | Run auth again |

Tune the deep check with:

```text
COPILOT_RELAY_DEEP_INTERVAL
COPILOT_RELAY_DEEP_MAX_TIME
```

Set the interval to 0 to turn off the deep check.

Health logs and state:

```text
~/Library/Logs/copilot-relay-healthcheck.log
~/Library/Caches/copilot-relay-healthcheck.deep
```

## npm cache cleanup

`com.d0n9x1n.npm-cache-clean` runs each Sunday at 03:17. It does not run at install time.

It:

- runs `npm cache clean --force`;
- removes `~/.npm/_npx` copies older than 14 days by folder change time;
- keeps Playwright browsers in `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright`.

Run it now:

```sh
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.npm-cache-clean"
```

Its main log is `~/Library/Logs/npm-cache-clean.log`. The script keeps at most 500 lines.

## MCP merge

`config/mcp/mcp-shared.json` contains only safe shared entries.

The installer merges them into local Copilot MCP data and then imports the server map into `~/.claude.json`.

Keys and tokens for optional MCP servers stay in local `~/.config/github-copilot/mcp.json`. Never put them in the shared file.

## Claude temporary-file cleanup

Claude lifecycle hooks and launcher traps clean only per-invocation owned roots under `/tmp/claude-code-<uid>-cleanup/roots/`. Playwright is pinned, isolated, and routed through a proxy that suppresses no-op browser closes. The browser cache is retained. Run `~/.claude/session-cleanup.sh inventory` for a read-only report of owned and legacy residue.

## WakaTime

Copilot uses the official `wakatime/copilot-cli-wakatime` plugin. Claude uses the official `wakatime/claude-code-wakatime` plugin.

The installer reads the key from `~/.wakatime.cfg`. If no key exists and the install is interactive, it asks for the key twice without printing it.

The installer also removes old WakaTime paths:

- the old local WakaTime MCP runtime and entries;
- Homebrew `wakatime-cli`;
- the old `@geeknees/copilot-cli-wakatime` npm package.

## Verify

```sh
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4142/healthz
copilot-relay status --deep; echo "exit=$?"
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay"
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay-healthcheck"
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.npm-cache-clean"
scripts/check.sh all
```

## Read these first

1. **`QUICKREF.md`** — single source of truth for how this repo works.
   Update it when behavior changes.
2. **`ReadMe.md`** — human-facing README. Update separately when
   user-visible details change.

## Repo summary

Personal dotfiles, synced across machines via git + symlinks. macOS-only;
`install.sh` is the single installer.

## Architecture rules

- **`mcp-shared.json` is for non-secret MCP entries only.** Anything
  needing a token/key goes in the gitignored
  `~/.config/github-copilot/mcp.json` per device — install.sh's merge
  step preserves it.
- **`claude/statusline.sh` and `copilot/statusline.sh` must stay
  functionally aligned.** Same segments, same output shape, same Catppuccin
  palette, same per-cwd 5s git cache. When you change one, port the
  change to the sibling. **Known intentional divergence (do not "re-align"
  away):** Claude's statusline has NO live-subagent renderings — neither the
  inline `subagents`/`Tasks` count nor the bottom live-agent tree — because
  Claude Code ships its own native subagent UI. Copilot keeps both, and its
  subagent glyph is the magic-wand (U+F0D0) while Claude has no subagent glyph
  at all. Claude Code handles concurrent admission natively; the statusline has
  no counter state to read.
- **Claude Code's native concurrent-subagent limit is set to 16.** Keep
  `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS="16"` in `claude/settings.json` and
  require Claude Code v2.1.217+. Do not describe it as an absolute ceiling:
  `/subtask` and resumed agents can pass the admission boundary, ultracode is
  exempt, and workflows/agent teams use separate limits. Do not restore the
  obsolete lifecycle counter hook.
- **launchd plists in `launchd/` are templates, not symlinks.**
  install.sh substitutes `__HOME__` -> `$HOME` (launchd doesn't expand
  `$HOME` at runtime) and `__SRC_DIR__` -> this repo's absolute path (for
  agents that exec a tracked script, e.g. `clean-npm-caches.sh`), writes the
  rendered file to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`, then `bootout`+`bootstrap` into
  `gui/<uid>`. macOS-only; install.sh skips this step on other OSes.
  Current agents: `com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay` (relay proxy, on login) and
  `com.d0n9x1n.npm-cache-clean` (weekly npm/npx cache prune, Sun 03:17).
- **install.sh bootstraps a brand-new Mac.** It installs Homebrew if missing,
  Homebrew formulae/casks (including Claude Code via `claude-code`), npm globals
  for Copilot CLI + `copilot-relay`, oh-my-zsh, custom RecMono fonts from
  `MOSconfig/recursive-code-config`, then links configs.
- **`.sonicterm/` is tracked config, not runtime state.** `install.sh` links only
  `.sonicterm/*.toml`, `.sonicterm/keymaps/*.toml`, and
  `.sonicterm/themes/*.toml` into `~/.sonicterm/`; do not commit SonicTerm
  `logs/` or runtime backup files.
- **This repo is a fork; keep upstream-owned files pristine.** `origin` is
  MsYouzi/dot-config (this copy), `source` is upstream D0n9X1n/dot-config.
  `.sonicterm/themes/wezterm.toml` is **upstream's** file (Gruvbox dark hard) and
  must stay byte-identical to `source/main` so `git pull source main` never
  conflicts on it. This fork's palette lives in its own file,
  `.sonicterm/themes/catppuccin-mocha.toml`, which upstream does not have;
  `sonicterm.toml` selects it with `theme = "catppuccin-mocha"` (SonicTerm
  resolves names against `~/.sonicterm/themes/<name>.toml`). Do **not**
  consolidate the palette back into `wezterm.toml` and do **not** "fix" it to
  match the theme name — the two-file split is deliberate and is what keeps
  upstream pulls conflict-free. Verify with
  `git diff source/main -- .sonicterm/themes/wezterm.toml` (must be empty).
  Note the rest of the repo (`.tmux.conf`, `wezterm/wezterm.lua`, both
  statuslines, `themes/apollo/*`) is still Catppuccin-diverged in place and
  will conflict on upstream pulls; that was scoped out deliberately.
- **Skills live once, in `claude/skills/`, and serve both runtimes.**
  `install.sh` links each `claude/skills/<name>/` into **both**
  `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` and `~/.copilot/skills/<name>/`. Copilot CLI reads
  personal skills from `~/.copilot/skills/` (its own `--help` says so:
  "Personal ~/.copilot/skills/ or ~/.agents/skills/") using the same
  `SKILL.md` + frontmatter format Claude Code uses. Claude Code is primary:
  author and edit skills under `claude/skills/` only. Do **not** create a
  parallel copy under `copilot/` — the whole point is one file, two symlinks,
  no drift.
- **`sync-upstream` is the skill for pulling from `source`.** When the user asks
  to pull/merge/sync upstream (D0n9X1n), follow
  `claude/skills/sync-upstream/SKILL.md` rather than improvising: it encodes the
  merge-not-rebase rule, the per-file conflict playbook, and the four
  `.sonicterm/` invariants that prove the fork's theme survived.
- **`.copilot-relay/config.yaml` is tracked config, not auth state.**
  `install.sh` links only that file into `~/.copilot-relay/`; never commit
  `github_token`, `copilot_token.json`, or relay logs.

## Conventions

### Shell scripts (.sh)

- `set -euo pipefail` strict mode.
- Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS default). Avoid `${arr[@]}` quirks,
  `\u` escapes, associative arrays, `printf '%(...)T'`.
- POSIX-portable utilities: `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, `find -print0`,
  `stat -f %m || stat -c %Y` fallback (Darwin vs GNU).
- Statusline scripts use `printf -v __SEG` instead of `$(seg_$s)`
  capture — saves one fork per segment.

### Config files

- Color scheme: **Catppuccin Mocha** (WezTerm builtin); matching
  Catppuccin accents in tmux + statusline.
- Statusline label icons are **FontAwesome** glyphs (U+F0xx–F2xx),
  rendered via raw UTF-8 bytes in bash (since bash 3.2 doesn't support
  `\u`).
- Five-line layout: literal `\n` tokens in `SEGMENTS` introduce line
  breaks. L1 time/run/api/cost · L2 model/effort/context ·
  L3 mcp/skills/agents/style · L4 cwd path · L5 repo/branch/diff/stash/worktree.
- Default statusline icon accents should avoid repeating colors for adjacent
  segments and for segments in the same visual column.

## When you make changes

- **Bump version + tag**. We use semver-ish tags (`v0.X.Y`); patch for
  bugfixes, minor for new features, major for breaking changes.
  Pushing a `v*.*.*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which
  publishes a GitHub Release whose body is the commit-subject list between
  the new tag and the previous reachable `v*.*.*` tag.
- **Update QUICKREF.md** when behavior changes — the agent-facing brief
  must stay accurate.
- **Update ReadMe.md** when user-visible details change.
- **Run local/CI parity checks**:

  ```bash
  scripts/check.sh all
  ```

  CI runs the same script: macOS uses `scripts/check.sh smoke`; Ubuntu
  installs ShellCheck and runs `scripts/check.sh shellcheck`.

## Things that have bitten us

- `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.claude.json` are **different files**
  with different responsibilities. Settings: behavior. `.claude.json`
  (top level): MCP servers + state.
- `refreshInterval` is **nested inside `statusLine`**, not top-level.
  Trust the binary's strings table over documentation.
- `permissions.defaultMode: "bypassPermissions"` is **silently rejected**
  by Claude Code's binary ("bypassPermissions mode is disabled by
  settings"). The CLI flag `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` IS
  honored. Wrap launchers (oh-my-zsh-custom/claude.zsh,
  oh-my-zsh-custom/cc.zsh) to inject the flag.
- `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt` is dead config (only meaningful
  when bypass mode is active, which is gated off in settings). Claude
  Code's runtime sometimes re-adds it on its own writes; treat as noise.
- WezTerm's `inactive_pane_hsb` defaults to `{1, 0.9, 0.8}` — that
  desaturates unfocused windows and makes side-by-side comparisons
  look mismatched. Set `{1, 1, 1}` to disable.
- tmux 3.2+ uses `terminal-features ... :RGB` to advertise truecolor;
  `terminal-overrides ... :RGB` alone leaves tmux quantizing into the
  256-color cube.
- GitHub's hosted MCP doesn't support OAuth Dynamic Client Registration
  with Anthropic's SDK. Use Bearer-PAT auth in HTTP headers (per
  github/github-mcp-server's official Claude Code guide).

## Model-routing convention (claude/settings.json)

Sonnet and Opus are treated as **separate model families** by user
convention. Current routing:

- **Default** (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` + zsh wrappers) → `claude-opus-5[1m]`. Relay
  matches the `opus` substring and maps it to upstream `claude-opus-5`,
  ignoring the suffix; the `[1m]` suffix keeps Claude Code's 1M-context
  accounting (bare custom names fall back to 200k).
- Opus 4-5 / 4-6 / 4-7 / 4-8 / 5 → `claude-opus-5[1m]` — the **startup
  default**. Any Claude-facing label containing `opus` routes to
  upstream `opusModel: claude-opus-5`.
- Sonnet 4-5 / 4-6 → Claude-facing `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]` (relay upstream = `gptModel`)
- Haiku 4-5 → `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`
- gpt-5-mini → `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`

The GPT route stays fully configured at max effort + 1M context and is
reachable via `/model` or `--model 'gpt-5.6-sol[1m]'`; Claude's
Sonnet/Haiku/small-fast side-task tiers still use it.

When asked to "use the same model for the family", apply within Opus or
within Sonnet — never both. When adding a new alias, default to the
family rule above.

## Don't do

- Don't commit secrets. The repo is public on github.com/D0n9X1n/dot-config.
- Don't add files outside `claude/`, `copilot/`, `oh-my-zsh-custom/`,
  `wezterm/` without updating install.sh.
- macOS-only. The repo is not regression-tested on other platforms.
- Don't `--no-verify` git commits unless the user explicitly asks.

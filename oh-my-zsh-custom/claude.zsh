# claude (function wrapper)
#
# Bare `claude` is overridden as a function (not an alias — aliases can't
# pass through positional args like `claude --resume`). It tacks on
# `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` so every invocation runs in
# bypass mode, matching the global behavior we'd want from settings.json
# but can't have (the binary rejects defaultMode="bypassPermissions" with
# "...is disabled by settings"). The flag is the only path the binary
# honors.
#
# Model + effort defaults live in ~/.claude/settings.json
# (claude-opus-4.8, effortLevel = "xhigh"); to switch models mid-session
# use Claude Code's `/model <name>` — the proxy passes free-form model names
# through.

# claude/

Symlinked into `~/.claude/`. Bridges Anthropic's
[Claude Code CLI](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) to **GitHub
Copilot** models via a local [`copilot-relay`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copilot-relay)
proxy that translates Anthropic-format requests into Copilot ones.

```
claude (Anthropic CLI) -> http://127.0.0.1:4142 (copilot-relay) -> GitHub Copilot
```

`install.sh` only symlinks the **config files** in this folder
(`settings.json`, etc.); this `README.md` is excluded so it doesn't pollute
`~/.claude/`.

---

## One-time setup (per machine)

```bash
# 1. Install/update Claude Code (Homebrew cask), copilot-relay, and launchd.
bash ~/Public/dot-configs/install.sh

# 2. GitHub device-code login (browser opens, paste the printed code).
npx copilot-relay auth

# 3. Re-run install.sh so launchd starts the authenticated relay.
bash ~/Public/dot-configs/install.sh
```

After auth, `~/.copilot-relay/github_token` is written and the
proxy can mint Copilot tokens on-demand.

`install.sh` installs Claude Code via `brew install --cask claude-code`
(removing any old npm `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` first), installs/updates
`copilot-relay` via npm, and writes `~/.copilot-relay/config.yaml` with
`claudeSetup: false` so the relay does not rewrite this repo's symlinked
`~/.claude/settings.json`.

## Daily use

```bash
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay" | grep state
claude                                # interactive REPL
claude -p "explain this repo"         # one-shot
```

The `oh-my-zsh-custom/claude.zsh` wrapper launches `claude` with
`--permission-mode bypassPermissions`; model and effort defaults live in
`settings.json`.

```

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | Points Claude Code at the local proxy instead of `api.anthropic.com`. |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Required by Claude Code's startup check. `dummy` is fine; real auth happens via `npx copilot-relay auth`. **First launch will prompt** "Use this custom API key? (y/N)" — pick **Yes**, otherwise it lands in `~/.claude.json#customApiKeyResponses.rejected` and Claude refuses to use it. |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | Claude Code-facing default, `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`. The `[1m]` suffix keeps Claude Code's 1M-context accounting (a bare custom name is treated as 200k). Relay maps this non-`opus` name to upstream `gptModel` (currently `gpt-5.6-sol`), so the Claude-facing suffix is cosmetic relay-side. The Opus route stays reachable — pick it via `/model` or `--model 'claude-opus-5[1m]'`. |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | Routes every Sonnet alias through Claude-facing `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`; relay maps it to upstream `gptModel`. |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | Routes current Claude Code's Haiku tier, including sub-agents and small-fast side tasks, through `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`. |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` | Legacy small-fast alias for older Claude Code versions; pinned to `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`. |
| `env.MODEL_REASONING_EFFORT` | Kept for the custom statusline; upstream thinking is controlled by `thinkEffort` in `~/.copilot-relay/config.yaml`. |
| `env.CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS` | Claude Code's native concurrent-subagent limit, explicitly set to `16` (requires Claude Code v2.1.217+). |
| `effortLevel` | Claude Code's client-side reasoning budget. `low / medium / high / xhigh / max`. |
| `model` | Top-level default; set to `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`. Do not use `default` with `copilot-relay`, because relay routes non-`opus` names to `gptModel` — the `[1m]` suffix is what keeps Claude Code's 1M accounting (bare custom names are 200k). |

### Native concurrent-subagent limit

`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS=16` uses Claude Code's built-in
per-session admission limit. When 16 subagents are running, another Claude-
spawned `Agent` call fails with `Concurrent subagent limit reached`; launches
work again after the running count drops below 16. `install.sh` requires Claude
Code v2.1.217 or later so this setting cannot be silently ignored.

The native limit is intentionally not described as an absolute ceiling. A
user-started `/subtask` occupies a slot but is not blocked, resuming a finished
subagent can exceed the limit, and ultracode sessions are exempt. Workflow
agents and agent-team teammates use separate limits. The former lifecycle hook,
`jq`-parsed state, and lock files are no longer needed.

### Built-in `/model` menu

Claude Code's `/model` picker is **hard-coded** to its own lineup
(Default / Sonnet / Sonnet-1M / Haiku / Custom). There is no setting to
hide entries or substitute a custom list. The pragmatic workaround is the
`ANTHROPIC_*_MODEL` env vars above: Sonnet / Haiku / small-fast picks all
route to `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`, which is also the default. The Opus route remains
reachable via `--model 'claude-opus-5[1m]'`.

### Relay config

`install.sh` creates or updates `~/.copilot-relay/config.yaml`:

```yaml
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 4142
copilotBaseUrl: https://api.githubcopilot.com
claudeSetup: false
logLevel: info
logRetentionDays: 3
thinkEffort: max
gptModel: gpt-5.6-sol
opusModel: claude-opus-5
```

> **max + 1M context.** The default route is the Claude-facing `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`;
> relay treats it as a non-`opus` name and sends it to `gptModel`
> (`gpt-5.6-sol`), while `thinkEffort: max` asks the relay to forward max
> reasoning per request. The bracketed `[1m]` suffix lives on the
> *Claude-facing* name to engage Claude Code's 1M window; relay ignores the
> suffix. The Opus route (`opusModel: claude-opus-5`) stays configured and is
> reachable via `--model 'claude-opus-5[1m]'`.

## Gotchas hit while setting this up

| Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` shows the onboarding wizard / OAuth login every launch | `hasCompletedOnboarding` missing in `~/.claude.json` | Set `"hasCompletedOnboarding": true` in `~/.claude.json` (one-time, per machine — `~/.claude.json` is **not** synced via dot-configs because it carries per-machine state like `userID` and project list). |
| Claude refuses to start ("This API key is not approved") | First-launch prompt was answered "No"; `dummy` is in `~/.claude.json#customApiKeyResponses.rejected` | Move `"dummy"` from `rejected` to `approved` in `~/.claude.json#customApiKeyResponses`. |
| `400 model_not_supported` mid-session ("do you have status line?", title generation) | Claude defaults the small-fast model to a model Copilot doesn't expose, or relay routing is bypassed | Keep `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` and `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` pinned to `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`, and confirm `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points to `http://127.0.0.1:4142`. |
| `copilot-relay` rewrites `~/.claude/settings.json` | `claudeSetup` is true in `~/.copilot-relay/config.yaml` | Re-run `install.sh`; it sets `claudeSetup: false` and restarts the launchd agent. |
| `settings.json` shows working-tree drift after running `claude` | Claude Code rewrites the file on first launch to inject `theme`, `effortLevel`, etc. | Same caveat as Copilot CLI — selectively `git checkout` runtime-injected fields you don't want to commit. The committed shape is canonical. |

## Maintenance

- Stop/restart the proxy: `launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay"`.
- Inspect listener: `curl -sS -o /dev/null --connect-timeout 1 http://127.0.0.1:4142/healthz && echo "healthy"`.
- Refresh GitHub token: `npx copilot-relay auth` again, then re-run `install.sh`.
- Switch default model: edit top-level `model` in `settings.json`, plus
  `env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL` and `opusModel` / `gptModel` in
  `~/.copilot-relay/config.yaml`.
- Add a new launcher/helper: append to `oh-my-zsh-custom/claude.zsh` and
  `source ~/.zshrc`.

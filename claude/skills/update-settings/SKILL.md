description: Change any setting in the dot-configs repo correctly — edit the right file, mirror it to whatever it is coupled to, update QUICKREF.md + ReadMe.md, run scripts/check.sh, then apply it to this Mac via install.sh and reload the affected launchd agents. TRIGGER when the user asks to change, set, enable, disable, or tune configuration for any app this repo manages (Claude Code, Copilot CLI, WezTerm, tmux, SonicTerm, copilot-relay, launchd agents, zsh), or asks to re-apply/sync settings to the machine. SKIP for questions about what a setting currently is (just read the file), and for code changes that are not configuration.

# update-settings

Settings in this repo are **coupled**. A one-file edit is usually wrong: the
statusline has a sibling that must match, a model alias has a family rule, a
launchd plist is a template that must be re-rendered, and every behavior change
owes an update to QUICKREF.md. This skill makes the whole change.

Two phases. Run **EDIT** then **APPLY** by default. Run APPLY alone when the
user just wants the repo's current state pushed onto the machine ("re-sync",
"re-run the installer", "my symlinks are stale").

---

## Phase 1 — EDIT

### 1. Route to the right file

Never edit `~/.claude/*`, `~/.wezterm.lua`, or anything else in `$HOME`
directly — those are symlinks into this repo, and a direct edit either hits the
repo through the link (untracked as a repo change) or gets clobbered on next
install. Always edit the repo copy.

| Setting | Edit here | Lands at | Coupled to |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code behavior, env, model | `claude/settings.json` | `~/.claude/settings.json` | model family rule (below) |
| Claude statusline | `claude/statusline.sh` | `~/.claude/statusline.sh` | **`copilot/statusline.sh`** |
| Copilot CLI behavior | `copilot/settings.json` | `~/.config/github-copilot/` | — |
| Copilot statusline | `copilot/statusline.sh` | — | **`claude/statusline.sh`** |
| MCP server (no secret) | `mcp-shared.json` | merged into Copilot + `~/.claude.json` | — |
| MCP server (needs token) | `~/.config/github-copilot/mcp.json` | per-device, gitignored | never commit |
| Relay routing / effort | `.copilot-relay/config.yaml` | `~/.copilot-relay/config.yaml` | `claude/settings.json` model names |
| Terminal | `wezterm/wezterm.lua` | `~/.wezterm.lua` | tmux truecolor, theme |
| tmux | `.tmux.conf` | `~/.tmux.conf` | WezTerm truecolor |
| SonicTerm | `.sonicterm/**.toml` | `~/.sonicterm/` | — |
| Shell aliases / wrappers | `oh-my-zsh-custom/*.zsh` | `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/` | permission-mode flags |
| launchd agent | `launchd/*.plist` (**template**) | rendered to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` | must re-render + reload |

### 2. Apply the coupling rule that fits

**Statusline parity.** `claude/statusline.sh` and `copilot/statusline.sh` must
stay functionally aligned: same segments, same output shape, same Gruvbox
palette, same per-cwd 5s git cache. Change one, port it to the other.

One intentional divergence — **do not "re-align" it away**: Claude's statusline
has no live-subagent rendering at all (no inline `subagents`/`Tasks` count, no
bottom live-agent tree, no subagent glyph), because Claude Code ships native
subagent UI and admission. Copilot keeps both, with the magic-wand glyph
(U+F0D0).

**Model routing.** Opus and Sonnet are separate families. Applying "the same
model for the family" means within Opus **or** within Sonnet, never across.
Current startup default: `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`. Anything containing `opus` routes to
`claude-opus-5[1m]`; Sonnet/Haiku/small-fast route to `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`. Keep
the `[1m]` suffix — a bare custom name makes Claude
Code fall back to 200k context accounting instead of 1M.

**launchd.** Plists are templates, not symlinks. install.sh substitutes
`__HOME__` → `$HOME` (launchd does not expand `$HOME` at runtime) and
`__SRC_DIR__` → repo path, then `bootout`+`bootstrap` into `gui/<uid>`. Editing
the rendered file in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` is always wrong — it is
overwritten on next install.

**Statusline layout.** Five lines, `\n` tokens in `SEGMENTS` break lines:
L1 time/run/api/cost · L2 model/effort/context · L3 mcp/skills/agents/style ·
L4 cwd · L5 repo/branch/diff/stash/worktree. Icons are FontAwesome raw UTF-8
bytes (bash 3.2 has no `\u`). Avoid repeating an accent color between adjacent
segments or within a visual column.

### 3. Known traps

- `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.claude.json` are **different files**.
  Settings = behavior. `.claude.json` top level = MCP servers + state.
- `refreshInterval` nests **inside** `statusLine`, not at top level.
- `permissions.defaultMode: "bypassPermissions"` is silently rejected by the
  binary. The `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` CLI flag *is* honored —
  that is why `oh-my-zsh-custom/claude.zsh` and `cc.zsh` wrap the launcher.
- `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt` is dead config; Claude Code re-adds it on
  its own writes. Treat as noise, do not build on it.
- Shell scripts: `set -euo pipefail`, **bash 3.2 compatible** (macOS default) —
  no associative arrays, no `printf '%(...)T'`, no `\u`. Use
  `stat -f %m || stat -c %Y` for mtime.

### 4. Docs, then checks

Behavior changed → **QUICKREF.md** (agent-facing, must stay accurate).
User-visible → **ReadMe.md**. Both if both.

```bash
scripts/check.sh all
```

CI runs the same script. Do not proceed while it is red.

---

## Phase 2 — APPLY

```bash
./install.sh
```

Idempotent: relinks symlinks, re-renders every launchd template, and
`bootout`+`bootstrap`s the agents. Correct links are left alone; mismatched
destinations are backed up as `<name>.bak.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` first.

Reload a single agent without a full install:

```bash
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay"
```

### Verify what you changed

```bash
# symlink landed where you think
ls -l ~/.claude/settings.json ~/.wezterm.lua ~/.tmux.conf

# agents loaded
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay" | grep state
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.d0n9x1n.copilot-relay-healthcheck" | grep state

# relay reachable end to end (spends a few tokens)
copilot-relay status --deep; echo "exit=$?"
```

Claude Code settings need a **session restart** to take effect. WezTerm and
tmux reload their own config; SonicTerm and the relay hot-reload.

---

## Ship

Semver-ish tags: patch = bugfix, minor = new feature, major = breaking.
Pushing `v*.*.*` triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, whose release body
is the commit subjects since the previous reachable tag.

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "..." && git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

If the change closes an issue, attach issue and PR to a milestone named for the
tag. Never `--no-verify` a commit unless the user explicitly asks.

## Never

- Commit a token, key, or `github_token` — the repo is **public**.
- Add a path outside `claude/`, `copilot/`, `oh-my-zsh-custom/`, `wezterm/`
  without an install.sh update to link it.
- Commit SonicTerm `logs/`, relay logs, or `copilot_token.json`.
- Add a non-macOS branch. This repo is macOS-only and untested elsewhere.

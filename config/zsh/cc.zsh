# cc [title]
#
# Sibling of `gg` (config/zsh/gg.zsh) but launches Anthropic's
# Claude Code CLI instead of GitHub Copilot CLI. Sets the active terminal
# tab + window title to [title] via OSC 1/2 and tells RMUX directly so the
# title sticks when nested, then runs `claude` in
# the current shell. If title is omitted, use the current directory path.
#
# Model + effort are pinned globally in ~/.claude/settings.json and injected
# here because Claude Code may rewrite settings.json at runtime.
# Permission mode CANNOT be pinned via settings.json — the binary explicitly rejects
# defaultMode="bypassPermissions" with "bypassPermissions mode is
# disabled by settings". So we pass --permission-mode at the command
# line on every invocation, which the binary does honor.
#
# See gg.zsh for the rationale on each title-update path; this is the
# same recipe with a different launcher.
